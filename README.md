# GLOOM

GLOOM is a WebGL-powered, old-school first-person-shooter style game inspired by titles like Wolfenstein 3-D and DOOM.

This game is being developed in entirety as part of my HTML5 First Person Shooter YouTube Series here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMvQQlx1L5w&list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPgdB1nl41SpcssTKskP2D5C
